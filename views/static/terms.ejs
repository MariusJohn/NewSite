    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
<p>Effective Date: April 29, 2025</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the My Car Quote platform. By using this website, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the service.</p>

<h2>2. Our Service</h2>
<p>My Car Quote is a platform that allows vehicle owners (“Customers”) to receive quotes from local bodyshops (“Bodyshops”) for private vehicle repair jobs. We are not a repair company or insurance intermediary. We do not guarantee the quality or price of any repair service quoted by bodyshops.</p>

<h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
<p>By submitting a job or quote, you agree to provide accurate information. You must not misuse the platform, submit false claims, or impersonate others.</p>

<h2>4. Quotes and Payments</h2>
<p>Quotes provided by bodyshops are non-binding until you contact or engage the selected provider. Payment of the quote access fee (£5) is non-refundable and grants you access to the bodyshops' details. My Car Quote does not take commission or mediate transactions between you and any bodyshop.</p>

<h2>5. Account Use (Bodyshops)</h2>
<p>Bodyshops must maintain accurate profiles and respond to quote requests in a professional manner. We reserve the right to suspend access for misuse, abuse, or inactivity.</p>

<h2>6. Data Privacy</h2>
<p>Your use of the platform is subject to our <a href="/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. We handle personal data responsibly and in line with applicable laws.</p>

<h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All content, branding, and designs on the platform are owned by or licensed to My Car Quote. You may not reuse or copy them without permission.</p>

<h2>8. Liability</h2>
<p>We are not liable for any loss, damage, or disputes arising from the use of quotes or services provided by third-party bodyshops. All agreements are between the customer and the bodyshop.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms at any time. The effective date will be posted above. Continued use of the platform indicates your acceptance of any changes.</p>

<h2>10. Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions about these Terms, contact us at <strong>office@mcquote.co.uk</strong>.</p>
